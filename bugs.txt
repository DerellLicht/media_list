> tdm32: I still can't use either _tmain() nor wmain(); 
  I get the WinMain16 not found error...
  
  For now, I'm sticking with 32-bit compiler and main()...
  I take inputs in ASCII, then convert them to Unicode before proceeding.
  The result of this, is that I won't be able to input Unicode paths,
  but any Unicode filenames that I encounter, will be displayed properly.

> On redirection, neither current method outputs Unicode text.

> on 64-bit build, .avif and .tif files fail to open
  Also, executable size goes from 230K to 816K
